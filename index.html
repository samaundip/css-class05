          <p id="p-tag01"> 
            Hard work is very important for achieving success. When we work hard, we put in the effort and time needed to reach our goals. It means staying focused, being determined, and not giving up, even when things get tough. People who work hard often learn new things and improve their skills, which helps them move closer to their dreams. While luck and talent can help, it is usually the hard work that makes the biggest difference in finding success. <br><br>
         
            Hard work is a crucial key to achieving success in life. When we commit ourselves to working hard, we demonstrate dedication and determination toward our goals. Hard work means putting in the time and effort needed to improve our skills and knowledge, even when we face challenges or setbacks. It requires us to be disciplined and stay focused, pushing through obstacles that may come our way. Many successful people share stories of how their hard work helped them overcome difficulties and ultimately reach their dreams. While some may be born with talent or have opportunities handed to them, it is often the consistent effort and perseverance of hard work that makes the biggest difference. By working hard, we can learn valuable lessons, grow as individuals, and move closer to achieving our aspirations, no matter what they may be.

        <h1 id="story01"> Greed leads to sin and to death </h1>
    
        <p id="p-tag02"> 
            Once upon a time there lived three friends in a certain village. One day they set out on a long journey on foot. They promised to help one another and to be helpful and when any problem arises. On the way, they had to pass through a jungle. All on a sudden, they saw a bag of gold lying on the ground. They became elated with joy and decided to divide them equally into three parts so that they each could get an equal share of the gold coins. <br><br>

            Meanwhile, they got tired and hungry. Through negotiation, they sent one of the friends to the nearby market to fetch some food. While he went for food, the two other friends plotted against him to the effect that he would be killed lest he should be given one-third of the shares. <br> <br>
            
            On the other hand, while going for food, he thought to himself that the food should be poisoned so that he alone could get all of the gold coins. He returned with food mixed with poison. No sooner had he returned than the two other friends got him strangulated to make sure that he died. They felt contented and sat together to eat the food without any least shadow of doubt about its being poisoned. They ate and were poisoned to death. The bag of gold remained to lie on the ground without anybody alive to claim the ownership. It was a great tragedy that there was no owner of the asset who deserved it.

    <h1 id="story02">If you can't do it once, watch it a hundred times</h1>


    <P id="p-tag03">
        The phrase "If you can't do it once, watch it a hundred times" speaks to the power of observation and learning through repetition. It suggests that mastery often comes not just from direct experience, but from absorbing information and techniques through careful observation. Whether it's a complex dance routine, a challenging recipe, or a difficult math problem, watching someone else perform the task can provide valuable insights that might not be apparent at first glance. <br> <br>

        This approach emphasizes patience and persistence; it's a reminder that learning is a journey. Each viewing can reveal new details or techniques that you might have missed before, allowing you to build a deeper understanding over time. Moreover, this method can help to foster motivation. By seeing others succeed, you can inspire yourself to keep trying, knowing that with enough practice and observation, you too can achieve similar results. Ultimately, it's about embracing the process of learning and recognizing that every attempt, whether successful or not, contributes to your growth'
